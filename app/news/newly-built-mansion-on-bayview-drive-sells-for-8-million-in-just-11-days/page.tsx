            A newly-built mansion at 837 Bayview Drive sold October 21 for nearly \$8.58 million, after spending just 11 days on the market before going under contract last month.

            Listed September 13 as a “coming soon” offering, the five-bedroom property quickly drew multiple bids and was under contract by September 24. The deal closed \$80,000 over ask, a clear sign of competition for scarce lakefront listings. Agents declined to confirm whether it was a cash deal, though the closing timeframe suggests that’s possible.

          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            The home sits on less than half an acre about a mile-and-a-half from downtown Lake Geneva, with 102 feet of lake frontage and two private piers.

            The 11-day sprint to contract stemmed from pinpoint timing and presentation. Professional staging showcased the home’s potential, while drone footage highlighted the 102-foot frontage and dual piers—rare commodities on Geneva Lake.
