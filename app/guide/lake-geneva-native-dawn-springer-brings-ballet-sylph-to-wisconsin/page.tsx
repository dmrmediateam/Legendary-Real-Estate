            This early exposure ignited her passion, leading her to intensive training at the North Carolina School of the Arts at age 15 in 1997. After honing her skills, Springer pursued a professional career, performing worldwide and eventually founding Dawn Springer Dance Projects in Milwaukee. Her work often explores themes of femininity, identity, and the human experience in dance. Last summer, Springer and her team conducted rehearsals and a work-in-progress presentation of “Sylph” at the Broadway Academy of Arts and Dance in Lake Geneva, fostering local connections and inspiring young dancers. “Being in Lake Geneva certainly helped foster our imagination during this process,” she noted.

            “Sylph,” a contemporary ballet choreographed by Springer, delves into the intricate struggles faced by female professional dancers, both on and off the stage. Drawing from mythological sylphs, ethereal, fairy-like creatures symbolizing slender, graceful women, the production reimagines these archetypes to challenge traditional roles in ballet. Performed in-the-round for an intimate experience, “Sylph” combines virtuosic ballet with percussive soundscapes by acclaimed composer Jon Mueller, creating a moody, ceremonial atmosphere that escalates from low pulses to fiery intensities. The cast features an international ensemble of talented dancers: Alana Griffith, Amanda Lewis, and Kristen Marshall from the United States; Sejain Bastidas from Venezuela (now in Canada); and Rinka Matsuura from Japan. These performers bring diverse backgrounds, having graced stages worldwide, adding depth to the narrative of resilience and vulnerability. Mueller’s score, a collaboration with Springer spanning years, emphasizes “virtuosity combined with exactitude,” mirroring ballet’s rigor.
