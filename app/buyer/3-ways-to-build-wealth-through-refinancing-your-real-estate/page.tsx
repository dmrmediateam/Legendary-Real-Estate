            Savvy investors know there is a multitude of ways to build wealth through real estate, outside of just buying low and, hopefully, selling high. If selling is an option, then selling during this seller’s market is the perfect opportunity. But is there a way to build wealth even if you don’t want to sell?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            With interest rates as low as they are, there’s another way to build your wealth and that’s through refinancing. Here are three strategies to explore:
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Why on earth would you refinance with the same interest rate if you can get a lower rate now than at the start? You wouldn’t. However, we won’t always have these historic low interest rates, so it’s good for you to see the impact of simply refinancing your existing loan.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Below is a chart showing how a 30-year loan of \$500,000 at a 6.75% interest rate with an annual mortgage of about \$29,000 would pan out over 10 years.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            However, if you refinanced at year 5 for the remaining balance of your loan, with the same interest rate, and amortization period, here would be your new loan payment:
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            That’s a 6.34% decrease from your original annual mortgage payment and a net saving of almost \$12,445 from year 6 to year 10. Granted, your loan is paid off more slowly because your mortgage rate is smaller. However, it’s not an issue if you’re in it for the long haul.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Here’s where it gets fun! If we have a lower loan balance and interest rate, that’s when we’ll start to see a significant reduction in our annual mortgage payment.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            After refinancing, now we see a 35% reduction in our annual mortgage payment and a net savings of about \$69,000  from year 6 to year 10. As a bonus, our ending home loan balance is smaller. Wey less while having a lower mortgage payment because our interest rate payments are significantly less. Thus, we’re paying more principal and less interest.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Suppose the home you purchased at \$500,000 appreciates on par with inflation at 3%. We can expect our property to be worth about \$579,637 at year five:
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            What would happen if we refinanced at the property’s new value and paid off our existing loan?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            The amount of equity you have depends on your home’s current value, and what you have remaining on your mortgage loan balance.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            If you’re not looking to sell because you’re in it for the long haul, it doesn’t mean you are sidelined from the wealth-building game. Right now is a great time to refinance to either lower your payments and or lower your payment while extracting equity so that you can perhaps in another real estate investment.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            There is a caveat to this and that is timing is everything. Meaning, it depends on where we are in the real estate cycle. Refinancing to lower your monthly payments is a great strategy for all phases of the real estate cycle, however, it is very difficult to do in the middle of a recession. Furthermore, extracting equity to buy another home at the peak of the market is extremely risky if the property value in the new home slumps. You will definitely want to do your research to find out where prices are going. If you have questions about it, reach out to us as we’d be happy to help you strategize how to maximize the wealth of your real estate portfolio.
