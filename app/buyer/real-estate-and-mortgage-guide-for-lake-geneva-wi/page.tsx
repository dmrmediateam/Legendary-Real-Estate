            You can choose loans with 15-year or 30-year terms. They provide steady payments, making budgeting easy. The 15-year option costs more each month but saves on total interest. The 30-year choice is better for those who want lower payments. For example, you might pay \$1,500 to \$2,000 a month for a \$250,000 to \$350,000 home at a 6.5% interest rate.
