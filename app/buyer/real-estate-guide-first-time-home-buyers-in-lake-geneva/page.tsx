            Key Factors to Consider When Buying in Lake Geneva
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Buying your first home in Lake Geneva requires careful planning, and Legendary Real Estate Services is here to guide you. Location is critical, Downtown offers convenience, while Geneva National provides calm. Proximity to schools like Lake Geneva Middle School (with above-average test scores) or amenities like Riviera Beach boosts livability and resale potential.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Market trends matter too. Lake Geneva leans toward a seller’s market due to tourism appeal, with homes averaging 45 days on the market, faster than the national 60-day average. Prices have risen 6% year-over-year, but starter homes remain within reach. Our agents provide real-time data to help you strike at the right moment. Property condition is key, older cottages may need updates (e.g., plumbing or roofs), while new builds offer ease. A home inspection is a must to avoid surprises.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Consider community factors like a low crime rate (1.5 violent incidents per 1,000 residents vs. the U.S. average of 4.0) and tourism-driven growth, alongside financials, property taxes average 1.7% of assessed value, and HOA fees may apply in condos. We’ll ensure your purchase aligns with your budget and future plans.
