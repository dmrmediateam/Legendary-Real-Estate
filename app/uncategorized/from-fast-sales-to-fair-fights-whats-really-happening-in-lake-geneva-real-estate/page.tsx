            If you’ve been wondering whether the Lake Geneva real estate market is still hot—or headed for a cool down—we’ve officially stepped into that sweet spot: a balanced market.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            This means we’re right at the peak turning point—moving from an overheated seller’s market into early equilibrium.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            That’s where the magic (and the negotiation) really starts to happen.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Here’s what’s going on, what it means for buyers and sellers, and how to play your cards right if you’re thinking about making a move.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            The number of months it would take to sell all homes currently on the market if no new ones were listed.

          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            We said last month we’d be in a balanced market soon—and here we are. Inventory is up, and so are months of supply:
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            The average number of days it takes for a home to get an accepted offer after it’s listed. Lower DOM = faster-moving market. Buyers are taking a few more days to commit, but homes are still moving quickly:

          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            What percentage of the asking price homes are actually selling for.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Above  100% = homes are selling more than asking.Below 100% = room for negotiation.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            We’re seeing a slight softening, but homes are still commanding strong offers:

            Quick Story:One of our buyers fell in love with a model home—brand new, sparkling, zero previous owners.But the builder’s stiff counteroffer and unwillingness to budge? Major turnoff. Especially when I showed the buyers that there were other new builds on that same street that had been sitting for some time on the market – so that builder had zero leg to stand on.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            The buyer walked and chose a different property. With these sellers, there was some give, and some take, but the sellers showed compromise and goodwill. That’s all buyers want.
          </p>

            Lesson? In a balanced market, fairness and flexibility close deals. More importantly, follow the golden rule: Don’t be a dick.

            The middle sale price of all homes sold. A good snapshot of market value trends.

            💡 Demand is strong and listings are up, which means:

            In Walworth County, the sweet spot is still:

          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Lake Geneva’s real estate market is no longer leaning hard in one direction.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            We’re balancing—more listings, slightly longer market times, and just enough negotiating power on both sides.
