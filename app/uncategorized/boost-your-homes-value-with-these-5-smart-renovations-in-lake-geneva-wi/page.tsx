            A functional, updated kitchen is a top priority for buyers in the Lake Geneva WI real estate market. The good news? You don’t need to spend a fortune. A minor kitchen remodel—think updated appliances, fresh countertops, and cabinet refacing—can yield an ROI of 70%–80%.

            Pro Tip for Sellers: Stick to mid-range upgrades that appeal to a broad audience. Bold luxury additions might not pay off unless your home is in a high-end Geneva Lakes area neighborhood.

            Adding usable square footage is one of the most effective ways to increase your home’s value. Converting your basement or attic into a functional living space, like a home office, family room, or gym, can attract buyers looking for extra space.
