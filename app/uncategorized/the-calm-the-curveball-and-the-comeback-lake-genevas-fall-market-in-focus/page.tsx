            If you’re feeling like this market can’t quite make up its mind — you’re not wrong. The Lake Geneva real estate market is sending mixed signals this fall, and the truth is, that’s actually good news… for the savvy.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Whether you’re thinking about buying or selling a home in Lake Geneva, WI, this is one of those rare moments when both sides have an advantage — if they understand what the numbers are really saying (and what they’re politely leaving out).
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Walworth County: Up to 4.25 months of inventoryLake Geneva: Up to 4.73 months of inventory
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            After a long run of favoring sellers, we’re officially cruising through a balanced market — and it’s becoming even more balanced each month.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Translation: Neither side is holding all the cards.For sellers, gone are the days of 12 offers before lunch. For buyers, the days of panic-bidding \$50K over asking are (thankfully) fading into folklore.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            But here’s the twist — we have plenty of listings, especially between \$300K–\$1.5M, yet the most active sales are concentrated between \$300K–\$500K.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            So, yes — homes are sitting. But not because demand’s gone quiet.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            High-end homes aren’t lagging because buyers disappeared — they’re lagging because buyers got selective.With higher rates and more inventory, affluent buyers now have choices. That means design, layout, and even lifestyle flow matter more than square footage or finishes.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Translation for sellers: Price it smartly or sit.Translation for buyers: The right home may not get cheaper, but it’s suddenly negotiable.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Walworth County: Down to 45.7 daysLake Geneva: Down to 55.8 days
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Wait a second… How can we have more inventory and faster-moving homes at the same time?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            It’s the market’s version of a paradox — but a logical one.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            The homes that are priced right, staged well, and marketed like they matter? They’re flying off the shelf.The ones listed emotionally (read: too high) are sitting quietly in the background, skewing perception but not performance.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Walworth County: Up to 96.1%Lake Geneva: Up to 99.4%
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Even with rising inventory and cooler temps, sellers are still capturing nearly full asking price.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            That’s not normal for this kind of balance — but it’s a sign that serious sellers are pricing strategically, and serious buyers are responding accordingly.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            A lower ratio in a balanced market doesn’t spell weakness — it signals discipline. Buyers are rewarding realistic sellers with near-asking offers, while “wishful pricers” quietly extend their DOM (Days on Market) stats.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Sellers: A well-priced home doesn’t need to discount deeply to sell fast.Buyers: You can still negotiate — just not on homes that have already nailed their list price strategy.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Walworth County: Up to \$440,000Lake Geneva: Up to \$650,000
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Both are holding — and even rising slightly — despite broader market chatter about “softening.”
