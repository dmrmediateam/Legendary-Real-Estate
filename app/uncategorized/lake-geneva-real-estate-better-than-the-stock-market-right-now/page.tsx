            By Jade GoodhueIf watching the stock market gives you heartburn, but you still want to grow your wealth… good news: 🏡 Real estate, especially in the Geneva Lakes area, is still a solid and stable investment.

            Let’s break down the local numbers and what they mean for you as a buyer/seller.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Anything under 4 months of inventory is considered a seller’s market—but we’re inching toward balance. That’s because listings are climbing. So, while sellers still hold a slight edge, buyers have gained ground. Prices won’t truly start softening until there’s over 6 months of inventory. That’ll take time, a lot of it, with the lock in effect and new builds nowhere near outpacing demand. Especially with housing permits only up 9.6% in the first quarter of 2025 as compared to the first quarter of 2024.

            💡 Sellers: List while you still have leverage.💡 Buyers: More options are coming— it’s still competitive, especially if it’s a good deal so you don’t want to drag your feet either.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            That’s the number of days it takes a home to go under contract, and especially in Lake Geneva, it’s fast. Homes in Lake Geneva are flying off the shelves, especially those that are well-priced and turnkey.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            💡 Sellers: Get ready to pack quickly.💡 Buyers: Be decisive. This is not the market for cold feet or “just browsing.”

          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Homes are selling close to their final asking prices. That’s a sign of a strong but not frantic market—balanced and stable.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            💡 Sellers: Don’t expect 10 offers over asking, but with smart pricing, you’ll get what your home is worth.💡 Buyers: Skip the lowballs. You’ll get a fair deal, but not a steal.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Prices are holding strong thanks to healthy demand and growing—but still limited—inventory. This isn’t the price dip buyers were hoping for.

          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            💡 Sellers: Now’s a great time to cash in on equity.💡 Buyers: Waiting for prices to drop? That may not happen—at least not here.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            💡 Sellers in this zone: You’re sitting on gold.💡 Buyers: These homes go fast—bring your A-game and a preapproval letter.

            Yes, foreclosure activity ticked up nationwide in April. But Wisconsin is ranked 46th in the U.S.—and only 280 homes across the whole state entered foreclosure. You’re more likely to spot Bigfoot on the Lake Geneva shore than stumble on a foreclosure here. Unfortunately though, Kenosha and Racine County are ranked top 5 in the state with the highest foreclosure.
