            If you’ve been poking around at homes for sale in Lake Geneva, WI, you’ve probably noticed two things: (1) there are a lot of pretty listings sitting longer than expected, and (2) the good ones? They’re gone before you can even book a second showing.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Welcome to our current balanced market — where both buyers and sellers have leverage. And where emotions, wishful thinking, and “but Zillow says…” can sink a deal faster than a pontoon boat with a slow leak.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Oh, and let’s not forget — the average 30-year mortgage rate is hovering around 6.5%. That’s shaping how buyers are thinking and what sellers need to know.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            That’s Realtor-speak for: if no new homes came on the market, it would take about 4 months to sell through everything currently listed. Four months = balance. Not too hot, not too cold.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            👉 For Sellers: With rates at 6.5%, buyers are being extra cautious about overpaying. Your home isn’t guaranteed to fly off the shelf unless it’s priced right. If you overshoot because you’re emotionally attached or “need a certain number,” your home is going to sit… especially in the higher-end ranges.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            👉 For Buyers: You’ve got choices! And choices mean leverage. The \$350K–\$650K range is where the most homes are selling in Walworth County, but the bulk of listings are actually between \$300K–\$1.5M — with plenty of high-end homes that aren’t exactly being fought over right now. And at 6.5%, affordability matters.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            So why are so many homes sitting? A few reasons:
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            I had motivated buyers in the \$700K–\$850K range. They loved a home listed at \$879K, recently dropped from \$899K. But comps told me it wasn’t worth more than \$840K. We wrote a fair offer, sellers countered with a measly \$5K drop, and it was clear they were emotional about the price.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            So, I told my buyers: “Plenty of fish in this lake — let’s move on.” Sure enough, we found another home priced realistically. We wrote, they accepted, and it was under contract the next day.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Moral of the story for sellers: Price with your head, not your heart. At 6.5%, buyers are looking closely at value, and they’re not going to stretch beyond what comps support.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            👉 For Sellers: Don’t panic. Fifty-some days is still perfectly normal in a balanced market. But if your home is languishing past that with crickets for showings, your price or presentation is the problem — and higher mortgage rates are making buyers pickier.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            👉 For Buyers: Longer days on market = more room to negotiate, which helps offset those 6.5% monthly payments.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Translation: Buyers are still paying close to list price — and a bit closer than last month.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            👉 For Sellers: You’ve got buyers, but remember, they’re calculating every dollar against a 6.5% interest rate. Expect offers to be fair, not frothy. Concessions might be on the table, but you’re not powerless.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            👉 For Buyers: Yes, you’ve got leverage, but don’t mistake balance for a free-for-all. If a property is priced right, come in strong — or you’ll lose it to someone else.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Both ticked upward last month — a sign that demand is still there. But with mortgage rates at 6.5%, affordability plays a big role. What’s selling are homes priced realistically in the mid-range sweet spots, not the trophy homes waiting for a unicorn buyer.
          </p>
