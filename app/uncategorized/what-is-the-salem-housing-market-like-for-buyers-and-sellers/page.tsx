            Buyers must move quickly when they find a property they love. Scheduling tours promptly, preparing questions about the home’s condition or neighborhood, and securing a mortgage preapproval letter are essential. Non-cash buyers should have financing ready to compete with cash offers, which are common in Salem’s market.

Including a personalized offer letter or flexible closing terms can sometimes tip the scales in a competitive bidding situation.
