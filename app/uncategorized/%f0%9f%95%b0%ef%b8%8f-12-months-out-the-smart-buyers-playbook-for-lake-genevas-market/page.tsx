            Whether you’re a first-time, seasoned, or affluent home buyer, if you’re planning to buy a home in the next year — especially in the Lake Geneva area — congratulations, you’re already smarter than 80% of buyers.Most people start the process after they’ve fallen in love with a house online. Spoiler alert: that’s about six months too late.

          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Because there’s much more to buying a home than loan prequalification or credit repair – there’s asset strategy, privacy, liquidity, and timing.

            So getting a jump-start isn’t about being over-prepared — it’s about saving money, buying time, reducing your odds of heartbreak, and creating a legacy.

          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Here’s your 12-month-out playbook — the insider’s version of what savvy (and future-relaxed) buyers do now to win later.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Before you ever apply for a loan or set foot in an open house, start acting like a buyer now.

          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            💡 Why this matters: By the time you’re ready to buy, you’ll already know what “overpriced” looks like without me having to tell you. That kind of pattern recognition saves you from paying the “newbie premium” — the invisible 3–5% that excited buyers overpay because they’re emotionally late to the party.

            Here’s a fun secret lenders never post on Instagram: banks want your financial life to look boring and predictable.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            💡 Why this matters: Underwriters flag volatility. If you’re self-employed or have multiple income streams, “seasoning” your accounts 12 months out gives lenders 2–3 stable quarters to reference — potentially saving you thousands in higher interest or delayed approvals.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            This is the most counterintuitive step — but also one of the smartest.Meet with two or three lenders long before you need them. You’re not locking in rates; you’re auditioning relationships.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            💡 Why this matters: The best lenders often uncover financial tweaks you can make now to qualify for more or lower your debt-to-income ratio. And if you’re buying in the Lake Geneva market, where second homes, lakefronts, and condos have different lending rules, you’ll save serious time and headaches later.

            That \$50 “credit repair” subscription? Cancel it.Instead, pull your own credit report, not your score, and look for errors — especially accounts marked “open” that were closed or debts incorrectly listed.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Then, call the creditor yourself. A single corrected error can raise your score more than months of on-time payments.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            💡 Why this matters: Higher credit = lower mortgage rate = long-term savings.Every 20 points can translate to \$20K–\$40K in interest savings over a 30-year loan.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            If you expect your payment to be around \$4,000 a month and you currently pay \$2,500 in rent, start saving the \$1,500 difference every month now.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            💡 Why this matters: You’re building two things at once — a larger down payment and proof (to yourself) that you can comfortably handle that payment.By the time you buy, you’ll have a cushion that most buyers only wish they’d thought of.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Bonus: It trains your spending habits for ownership — and in this market, that’s gold.

            Lake Geneva and Walworth County have strict zoning rules, especially for lakefront, short-term rental, and multi-use properties.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            💡 Why this matters: The best deals often die in red tape. Knowing zoning early helps you pivot fast if your dream home comes with restrictions. It also means you won’t fall in love with a property you can’t use the way you want.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Everyone waits until they’re under contract to start building their circle — then scrambles to find inspectors, insurance agents, and contractors.Start now.

          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            💡 Why this matters: The best people get booked up months in advance — especially in Lake Geneva’s high season. Having them ready gives you an edge in negotiations and smoother timelines.
