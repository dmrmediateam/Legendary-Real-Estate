            If you own or manage a short-term rental (STR) in the City of Lake Geneva, a big deadline is approaching: April 30, 2025. That’s the cutoff for renewing or applying for your City of Lake Geneva STR license. With the rollout of a new software system called Rentalscape, the city is cracking down hard on illegal and noncompliant STRs.

          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            In this post, we’ll walk through what’s changing with the updated amended ordinance voted in end of 2024, what you need to do, and why staying compliant actually makes more financial sense than trying to cut corners.

          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            As of early 2025, the City of Lake Geneva has officially implemented Rentalscape, a short-term rental compliance and tracking platform. This software scans Airbnb, VRBO, and other platforms to automatically:

          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            If your property is not licensed or is in violation, Rentalscape will flag it. Fines will be automatic and steep. Repeat violations can result in suspension or revocation of your license, or worse: a ban from reapplying in the future.

            In the City of Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, operating a short-term rental (STR) without proper licensing and adherence to local ordinances can lead to significant penalties and enforcement actions. The city’s regulations are designed to maintain community standards and ensure the safety and well-being of both residents and visitors.

            Penalties for Noncompliance:

          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Residents are encouraged to report suspected unlicensed STR operations or violations to the City of Lake Geneva Building and Zoning Department. The city maintains a list of registered short-term rentals, and any property not on this list may be operating illegally. Complaints can be submitted through the city’s official channels.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Let’s say you own a 3-bed, 2-bath STR that rents for \$450/night, and you’re compliant for the legal 180-day max allowed in residential zones.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Compliant Host (Legal STR):
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Noncompliant Host (Over-rents beyond the 180-day limit at 70% annual occupancy):
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            If you’re caught operating illegally—especially under the radar of Lake Geneva’s new Rentalscape monitoring system—the city can:
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Once you’re flagged and fined, you may lose the ability to legally apply for or renew your short-term rental (STR) license in the future. If your property is in a restricted residential zone, you likely won’t be able to pivot and get another permit later—you’re done.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            If you’re operating without a license, the city will notify Airbnb, VRBO, and other platforms. These platforms have compliance agreements with cities like Lake Geneva and will remove your listings if they receive notice of noncompliance.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Beyond fines, persistent noncompliance could lead to injunctions or lawsuits, making it illegal to operate or advertise the rental at all.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Hence, the “\$0/year” potential future STR income. You might make a quick buck over-renting once, but the risk is losing all future cash flow, and potentially getting blacklisted from doing it again in that market.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            While over-renting might seem like it boosts profits in the short run, the long-term risks of being shut down and blacklisted from Airbnb and city licensure are far too great. One Rentalscape flag could end your business for good.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Adhering to Lake Geneva’s STR regulations is crucial for property owners to avoid severe financial penalties, legal actions, and potential loss of rental privileges. Ensuring compliance not only protects property owners but also contributes to the safety and harmony of the community.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Short-term rentals are still welcome in Lake Geneva—but only for those who follow the rules. With the Rentalscape system now fully live, noncompliance is no longer under the radar. If you want your rental business to survive past summer, you need to be licensed and compliant.
