            Is the Lake Geneva real estate market still hot? Cooling down? Or stuck in the weird limbo of “wait and see?” Here’s the truth: we’ve officially hit a balanced market.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            That’s Realtor-speak for:👉 Homes aren’t flying off the shelf anymore (but they’re still moving).👉 Buyers have options—but not a free-for-all.👉 Sellers have leverage—but not the upper hand.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            It’s negotiation season, baby—and if you play your cards right, both sides can win.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            What it is: The number of months it would take to sell all the current homes on the market if no new ones were listed.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            📌 What this means: Sellers – Your home won’t be snapped up in a bidding war unless it’s priced right and prepped like a pro. This isn’t 2021.Buyers – There are more homes for sale in Lake Geneva, WI, which means more choices—and fewer panic offers at midnight.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Quick Story: A homeowner was interested in selling his home – we did a comparative market analysis (CMA) and estimated the value of the property at \$1.65M. We lost it to an agent who listed it at \$2.2M. Here’s the deal, that home owner bought it for \$1.1M in 2020. The property hadn’t updated it since the 1990s, and there is a bigger and more impeccable home priced at \$900k down the street. How do you think this is going to go?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            What it is: The average number of days a home takes to get an accepted offer.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            📌 What this means: Sellers – This is still considered fast. If your home isn’t getting traction within two weeks, it’s probably pricing or presentation.Buyers – You don’t have to sprint, but don’t sleep on your dream home either. Especially if it has lake views.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            What it is: The percentage of the asking price that homes actually sell for.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            📌 What this means: Sellers – Buyers are still stepping up—if they feel like they’re getting value. Think thoughtful pricing, minor concessions, and clear disclosures.Buyers – It’s not a lowball market. If you’re the only one bidding, ask for credits. If there are others? Get real, fast.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            🔥 Real talk: There’s still strong demand. More listings just mean buyers are pickier. And sellers? You can’t act like it’s 2022. Compromise is key.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            📌 What this means: Sellers – The right home, at the right price, still gets top dollar. But if your house has 1990s carpet and avocado green appliances… maybe don’t ask peak 2021 prices.Buyers – Pricing is stable. That’s good news—it’s not spiraling upward, and it’s not crashing. It’s just… fair.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            📌 What this means: Sellers in this range – Position your home to shine. Staging, great photos, and savvy marketing matter.Buyers in this range – This is your battleground. Be decisive, but strategic. If the home is move-in ready, it won’t wait for you.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            We’re in what economists call the early equilibrium phase—right after the peak, but before any sharp decline (based on Mueller’s Real Estate Cycle from Daniels College of Business).
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            That means opportunity is everywhere… for those who are prepared.
