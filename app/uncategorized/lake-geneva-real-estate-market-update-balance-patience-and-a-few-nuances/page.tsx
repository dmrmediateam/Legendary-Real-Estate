            If you’ve been scrolling through homes for sale in Lake Geneva, WI, you’ve probably noticed something strange: some listings vanish in days, while others hang around longer than leftover pumpkin spice lattes in January. What gives?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Welcome to today’s market — a balanced one — where buyers and sellers both have leverage, patience is part of the game, and emotions (or egos) can make or break a deal. Let’s dig into what the latest numbers mean for you.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            That means we’re firmly in balanced territory — not a frenzied seller’s market, not a sleepy buyer’s market. Just balanced.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            💡 A higher absorption rate in Lake Geneva doesn’t necessarily mean it’s weaker. It often reflects the mix of luxury listings that naturally take longer to move. Translation: if you’re buying high-end, patience is your superpower.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            👉 For Sellers: A balanced market doesn’t mean “list high and they’ll still come.” In fact, it means the opposite: buyers have many choices here in Walworth County, and they’re picky. Especially with more homes sitting on the market from \$300K, all the way up past (\$1.5M+), the overpriced or under-updated ones are dragging down averages.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            👉 For Buyers: Don’t get lulled into thinking “balance” means no competition. In the sweet spot (\$200K–\$650K), homes are moving fast. If you’re in that range, expect competition. If you’re shopping in the upper tiers, you’ve got more room to negotiate.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            This is the average time from listing to accepted offer. Both are right in their historic ranges — 40–70 days for Walworth, 20–80 for Lake Geneva.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            👉 For Sellers: If your home’s been listed longer than the average, it’s the market politely telling you to reassess — usually price, condition, or presentation.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            👉 For Buyers: Longer days don’t always equal a desperate seller. In Lake Geneva, especially, it can mean the home was simply overpriced out of the gate. Savvy buyers know to watch for price drops rather than assume every “stale” listing is a steal.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            💡 Contrarian Thought: Sometimes, a home sitting 70+ days is a better buy than one that goes under contract in 5. Why? The frenzied ones often push prices up with multiple offers, while the slow movers are where real deals can be made.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            In plain English: homes are selling for about 6% less than asking in Walworth and 4% less in Lake Geneva.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            👉 For Sellers: That’s still very strong. It means if you price realistically, you’re going to land close to your number.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            👉 For Buyers: Don’t assume you’ll snag a 10% discount just because your uncle said the market’s slowing. In Lake Geneva, strong listings are still holding firm.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            💡 At 94% of asking (instead of closer to asking), it looks like it could be heading in a bad direction, that homes in Walworth County are selling for about 94% of asking (instead of closer to 100%), BUT it’s actually not. Why? Because the sellers who overprice — the “wishful thinkers” — are the ones pulling the average down when they eventually slash their price.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            The sellers who list realistically from the start? They’re still getting strong offers, often right near asking.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Translation: If you price your home fairly, buyers notice and step up. It’s the overpriced homes that are dragging down the stats, not the well-priced ones.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Both are down a bit from last month.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            👉 For Sellers: A dip in median price doesn’t mean your home’s value tanked. It usually means the mix of homes that sold leaned toward mid-range, not luxury.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            👉 For Buyers: This is where the opportunity lies. When luxury sits and mid-range moves, you can often negotiate better terms at the high end, while still competing hard in the middle market.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Whether you’re looking at homes for sale in Lake Geneva, WI, or considering listing your lakefront retreat, the right strategy — and the right Lake Geneva Realtor — makes all the difference.
