            Imagine owning a slice of paradise on the shores of Lake Geneva, where the gentle lapping of waves meets unparalleled luxury, and then selling it for a staggering \$20 million. That’s exactly what happened when William and Lois McEssy, a prominent McDonald’s franchisee from Lake Forest, Illinois, and his wife, parted ways with their breathtaking waterfront estate in Wisconsin.

            This Lake Geneva luxury waterfront home sale not only shattered expectations but also underscored the booming demand for high-end properties in the region. As one of the priciest transactions of 2025 so far, it highlights how affluent buyers from nearby Chicago suburbs are fueling a red-hot market for Wisconsin multi-million dollar home sales.

            William McEssy, a former attorney turned successful McDonald’s franchisee, and his wife Lois have deep roots in the business world and Lake Forest community. Starting in the early 1980s, McEssy built an empire, owning up to 46 franchises across Illinois and Wisconsin by the mid-2010s. Even after selling some in recent years, his legacy as one of the largest operators in the region endures. The couple, longtime residents of Lake Forest—an affluent Chicago suburb known for its stately homes—used their Lake Geneva property as a cherished retreat. Lois, alongside William, has been involved in philanthropic efforts, including establishing a professorship at Mundelein Seminary. Their decision to sell marks the end of an era for this power couple, whose McDonald’s franchisee Lake Forest real estate news has captivated local circles.

            The estate hit the private market in early June 2025, drawing five offers almost immediately, a testament to pent-up demand. The McEssys rejected a \$25 million bid from a buyer planning to demolish the home, prioritizing a match who would cherish it. Closing occurred less than three weeks later, likely a cash deal, as noted by buyer agent Jack Baker. Represented by Sal Dimiceli Sr. of Lake Geneva Area Realty for sellers and Baker of Coldwell Banker for buyers, the swift process highlights off-market efficiency in the \$20 million Lake Geneva property transaction arena.

Architectural highlights include elegant brick exteriors and interiors blending classic charm with modern luxury. Standout features:

            Lake Forest, Illinois, shares a symbiotic bond with Lake Geneva, just a short drive away. The McEssys exemplify this, using their estate as a weekend haven from Chicago’s hustle. Proximity to Chicago influences the market profoundly: Affluent Lake Forest residents, drawn by the 90-minute commute, view Lake Geneva as an extension of their lifestyle—think second homes for family getaways. This cross-state dynamic boosts demand, with many Chicago-area executives snapping up properties, as seen in recent sales to western suburb buyers. It’s no wonder Lake Forest McDonald’s franchisee real estate ties run deep here.
