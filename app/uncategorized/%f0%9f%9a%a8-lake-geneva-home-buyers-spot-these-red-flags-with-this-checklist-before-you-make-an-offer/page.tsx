            So—you found a home online, it looks gorgeous in the photos, and you’ve scheduled a tour. Exciting, right? Whether it’s your first home or your fifth, the showing is more than a walk-through—it’s your opportunity to really look under the hood. This blog will walk you through what to look, listen, and sniff for so you walk in like a buyer… and walk out like a boss.

            Yes, staging sells. The throw pillows are cute. The smell of cookies? Classic tactic. But don’t get distracted—your job is to look past the pretty and into the bones of the home.

            💡 Wisconsin Tip: A home built before 1990? You’ll want to ask if there’s knob-and-tube or aluminum wiring. And don’t forget to check if there’s GFCI protection in kitchens and bathrooms—those are code-required safety features.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Turn on the faucets. Flush the toilets. Take your time!
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Why it matters: Low pressure, slow drains, and stains in cabinets point to aging or leaking plumbing. Cast iron or galvanized pipes can be a big-ticket repair.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Bonus sniff test: Mold has a distinct smell—earthy, damp, sometimes sour. Your nose knows.

          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            We’re in Wisconsin—this matters.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Why it matters: Uneven temperatures or poor airflow mean insulation or ductwork may need updating. New systems or retrofits can cost thousands.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Bonus: Insulation isn’t always visible, but you can get a sense of how the home holds temperature. If the upstairs is hot and the basement is freezing, it may need duct balancing or insulation upgrades.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Forget the granite countertops. The basement will tell you everything.

          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Why it matters: Musty smells, efflorescence, or rust on furnace bases are signs of chronic dampness. Look for mold risk and sump pump functionality.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            🧰 Contractor Tip: If they have a dehumidifier running 24/7, ask why.

          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            🌳 Wisconsin-specific tip: Check how close mature trees are to the home—roots can affect foundations, and limbs can damage roofing during snow or wind.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Why it matters: Older or malfunctioning appliances might look fine, but they cost thousands to replace. Check what’s staying with the home.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Why it matters: In Wisconsin, sellers must disclose known issues. Read carefully—missing or vague answers can be a red flag worth investigating further.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Don’t be shy. You’re not being “difficult”—you’re being smart.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Here’s the truth: You’re not expected to catch every little thing on a home tour—and neither is the seller or the agent. That’s why most offers include a home inspection contingency.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            It means after your offer is accepted, you’ll hire a licensed home inspector to give the house a full top-to-bottom review. They’ll check everything from the roof to the foundation, plumbing to electrical, and everything in between. If they uncover major issues, like a cracked foundation, an old roof, or faulty wiring. If it uncovers legitimate defects, you’ll have the chance to:

          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            ✅ It’s your safety net. It protects you from buying a money pit or discovering hidden problems after you move in. So don’t stress if you’re not an expert during the tour—that’s what contingencies and inspections are for. You’re not alone in this.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            ⚠️ If a defect was already disclosed in the Real Estate Condition Report, it’s expected that you considered it when writing your offer. That means it likely won’t be negotiable later during the home inspection contingency.
