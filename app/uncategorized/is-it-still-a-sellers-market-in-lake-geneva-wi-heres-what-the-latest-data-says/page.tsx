            Let’s break it down—without the jargon—and make sense of what’s going on with homes for sale in Lake Geneva, WI.

          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            What it means: The absorption rate tells us how quickly homes are selling. Anything under 4 months is a seller’s market. So yes—Lake Geneva is still favoring sellers. But here’s the catch: the number of listings is rising fast, pushing us closer to a balanced market.

          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            💡 Sellers: List now while conditions are still in your favor.💡 Buyers: You’ve got more homes to choose from than a month ago—but if you’re looking for a home under \$500K, stay patient and strategic, but it’s still not for the faint of heart.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            That’s the average number of days it takes for a home to go from listed to accepted offer. This is at the low end of the normal range.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            💡 Sellers: A well-priced home in Lake Geneva should still sell quickly—especially if it’s move-in ready.💡 Buyers: If you love a property, don’t sit on it. Tour it, ask questions, and be ready to move. If you’re not a cash buyer, make sure your preapproval letter is ready to go.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            This means homes are selling just below asking price—and in many cases, over it.

            💡 Sellers: You don’t need to underprice to sell. But pricing it right is key to getting top dollar.💡 Buyers: Lowball offers? Not in this market. Be prepared to pay close to list—or more—especially if it’s a popular property.

            January 2025 saw a slight uptick in foreclosures nationwide, with 30,816 filings, up 8% from December. But Wisconsin ranks 41st in the nation for foreclosure rates, with 1 foreclosure for every 9,966 housing units. That’s only 276 filings that were recorded statewide. That’s low. So while foreclosure headlines grab attention, they’re not shaking up our market here in Lake Geneva.
