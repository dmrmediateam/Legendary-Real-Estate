            So you’ve narrowed it down that you’re most interested in Delavan Lake real estate.  That’s a big step with all of the lakes in the area.

          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            What you likely already know is that it’s quite large (about 1900 acres). It’s considerably less expensive than Lake Geneva. It’s a tremendous fishery. It’s great for water sports. It has a sailing-focused yacht club with a sailing school. Finally, it’s a natural lake and thus has a mostly mud bottom with little swimmable frontage.  If you’re good with all of this, let’s continue!
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            The home’s attributes:  Size, condition, bedrooms, baths, and price range.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            The property attributes: Subdivision lot, proximity to lake access, doesn’t matter much.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            The lake rights attributes: Boat launch, beach, park area, boat slips, private water frontage.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            The only major factor that will negate much of the choices is if you want a Delavan Lake waterfront home. If that’s the case, all of the smaller Delavan Lake homes in lake subdivisions with lake rights won’t fit the bill.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            From here, you’ll just have the decision of choosing to be on the main lake or spend somewhat less and be open to buying a Delavan main Waterfront home on the Delavan Lake inlet, outlet, or Brown’s channel. We’ll discuss all of these in a detailed article here.

          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            That decision rules out one entire category of property.  Now the question becomes, what kind of lake access are you looking for?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-black/70 leading-relaxed font-serif mb-6" style={{ letterSpacing: '0.02em' }}>
            Delavan Lake offers many subdivision associations of varying sizes.  The big difference here is the type of lake access. Here are the attributes of lake access offered on Delavan Lake.  These aren’t stand-alone. Any of them are often combined in different subdivisions.
