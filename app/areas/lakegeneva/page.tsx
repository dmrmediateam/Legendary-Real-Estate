            Waterfront homes and commercial real estate comprise the shoreline of this festive town with the City Center focal point being the City Lake frontage. With parks, sidewalks, boat rentals, and the iconic Riviera, the water frontage is the draw for many. Leading in both directions from downtown is the sought-after infamous Shoreline lake path that spans the entire perimeter of Geneva Lake and is truly an amazing way to spend or even a full day for the more adventurous who try to walk it all in one day.

            The rental market in the City and more broadly, the Geneva Lakes area is also robust and consists of single-family homes, apartments, and vacation rentals on an availability basis. Numerous properties are purchased each year as an investment for vacation rental income as many see this as a solid investment and diversification of their investment portfolio. New rules and regulations over the last 5 years from local municipalities and from Walworth County governing vacation rentals should always be investigated before buying to understand your options and opportunities.

            The jewel of Lake Geneva is of course the lake itself. There’s no better way to take in its splendor than taking a stroll, hike, or run along the lakeshore path. The shoreline of Geneva Lake is approximately 21 miles, but the path reaches up to almost 26 miles as it weaves in and out of wooded areas along the shoreline. There is so much beauty around Geneva Lake that you’ll want to frequent it over and over again. You can take the same route or take in new sights from different directions and segments of the path. There are multiple access points. You can enter it from either side of downtown Lake Geneva, Williams Bay, Fontana, or Linn township.
