            Could this price dip signal a buying opportunity, or are high-end sales skewing perceptions?Luxury and Vacation Home AppealThe Lake Geneva vacation homes market thrives in Abbey Springs, especially for luxury buyers. A Coldwell Banker listing highlights a 6-bedroom, 6-bath home at 158 Abbey Springs Dr. for \$1,995,000, boasting lake access and golf course views.
